		Bruce Lee Diet Rule 1: Avoid Refined Flour
	</h1>

	<p>The original Bruce Lee Diet article, by Jon Wade</p>

	<p>Generally Bruce Lee avoided refined flour. So, he did not eat many baked foods such as biscuits and cakes, which he described as being <strong
>empty calories</strong>. It is worth mentioning that today many people attribute irritable bowel syndrome to the excess consumption of refined flours. His philosophy was not to consume calories that did not provide some benefit to the body.</p>
<h2>Bruce Lee Diet Rule 2: Chinese Food

</h2>
<p>Bruce Lee enjoyed Chinese food, as he felt that western food was often too bland. Some of his favourite Chinese dishes were beef in oyster sauce and tofu. However, he loved to eat steak and liver too, but overall preferred the more balanced approach of Asian dishes. He felt that often Western food placed too much emphasis on protein and fat and not enough on carbohydrates from vegetables, rice, pasta etc</p>
<h3>
	Bruce Lee Diet Rule 3: Avoid Dairy Food

</h3>

<p>Bruce Lee did not like dairy food, and only ate dairy as part of protein drinks, usually using powdered milk instead of fresh milk. This rule only helps to reduce total energy intake. Calcium from dairy has been found to help reduce the amount of fat that is digested.
