	<p>Shaolin Kung Fu (Chinese: 少林功夫; pinyin: Shàolín gōng fu), also called Shaolin Wushu (少林武術; Shàolín wǔshù) or Shaolin quan (少林拳; Shàolín quán), is one of the oldest, largest, and most famous styles of wushu or kungfu. It combines Zen Buddhism and martial arts and originated and was developed in the Shaolin temple in Henan province, China during its 1500-year history. Popular sayings in Chinese folklore related to this practice include "All martial arts under heaven originated from Shaolin" and "Shaolin kung fu is the best under heaven," indicating the influence of Shaolin kung fu among martial arts. The name Shaolin is also used as a brand for the so-called external styles of kung fu. Many styles in southern and northern China use the name Shaolin.</p>
