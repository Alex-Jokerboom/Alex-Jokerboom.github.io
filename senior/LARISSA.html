            <p>"I never would have thought I would look forward to a gym session but with Mark’s support and encouragement it has changed my life in such a positive way." </p>
            <p>I am Stephen, a man of a certain age. </p>
            <p>I work for a local authority as a member of the management team in Learning Disabilities residential home – hours can be long and stressful. </p>
            <p>I would always use work being stressful as an excuse to eating junk and lots of treats. </p>
            <p>I would say "well it’s going to be a tough shift" or "that was a tough shift I deserve a treat". </p>
            <p>Enjoying my life, friends and family is so important to me, as is being active in my community. </p>
            <p>I always have an amazing birthday week and one year I woke up and thought the world needs more of me and I should not die early from a heart attack. </p>
            <p>I also started to lust after someone. </p>
            <p>I was obese, unfit and felt old, not that anyone would say. </p>
            <p> I started my own strict diet without any input from anyone else and I started to lose weight but I looked really old and flabby – I knew I needed to train or I would just be an old, flabby man and not what I wanted to be. </p>
            <p>I felt old and very fat, and would just buy clothes in an extra size. My biggest fear was not being able to do it – the sense of failure before starting. </p>
            <p>What if I could not do exercise at my age and size. </p>
            <p>I did wonder if a trainer would understand me and what I wanted. I was so fat and my weight topped at 18 ½ stone (117 kilos), XXL sizes in clothes. </p>
            <p> I would not do any fitness exercises and I would perspire like a flowing river even at the thought of exercise. I also knew I did not want to train in a public gym or go running in public. That would have stopped me before I got started. </p>
            <p> Mark having a private gym is amazing. Mark has so much confidence in me and my ability to train. He knows my body more than I do. When I think "no-way", Mark will encourage me. </p>
            <p>I achieve and feel so fabulous and feel a great sense of achievement after a session. </p>
            <p>I see changes in my body and I still get the wow factor at seeing bones, hips and muscles that were once covered by fat. </p>
            <p>I look younger and fitter than I have ever been. I look amazing now in clothes that actually fit. I am no longer self conscious looking in a mirror which is so unbelievable for me. I feel I can conquer the world, and my confidence when I walk in a room is so high. </p>
            <p>I look forward to my sessions as it’s me time. </p>
            <p>I attend a Dance Class weekly on top of 3 sessions with Mark and I have a new zeal for life and I am so much more happier with how I look. I have dropped 3-4 sizes in clothes and my metabolic age dropped by 17 years after being with Mark for a year. </p>
            <p>I never would have thought I would look forward to a gym session but with Mark’s support and encouragement it has changed my life in such a positive way. </p>
