            <h2 class="mb-5">Dee Barber</h2>
            <p>"My name is Dee Barber, I'm 71 years of age and am retired. </p>
            <p>My reason for signing up with Mark was I didn't want to be an old lady in 10 years time, walking with a stick and having a mobility problem. </p>
            <p>Before coming to Mark I felt drained, old and fat. </p>
            <p>I felt nervous and very unsure and my biggest concerns were: Am I too old to start training, what would he think of my shape and lack of fitness? </p>
            <p>I felt very self conscious not having ever been in a gym. </p>
            <p>Not knowing what to expect or wear. I felt extremely inadequate and worried about friends thinking I was silly or laugh at me, at what I was attempting to do.
              I felt embarrassed and very unsure of myself. </p>
            <p>I weighed 82.6kg and describe myself as fat and getting fatter. My dress size was 18+ </p>
            <p>I found walking difficult, which stopped me dog walking with my friends. I got out of breath going up stairs and always held on to the rail or stair in front of me. </p>
            <p>When walking I took small steps and was hunched forwards which gave me very bad posture. My knees were very stiff and I had to give up dancing which I enjoyed. </p>
            <p>I'd been thinking of doing something about it but not sure what, or where to go, as the thought of going to a public gym with lots of other people just scared me. </p>
            <p>So, after having spoken a year ago to a friend who had amazing results with Mark, I asked him for his details but I was still very unsure. </p>
            <p>Then, one morning I woke up and thought I just have to go for it! </p>
            <p>This took some courage, but I thought I'll just go and see if I like it and if I don't or I feel uncomfortable, I don't have to go back. </p>
            <p>This is when everything changed. </p>
            <p>After speaking with Mark at his free consultation, I felt I wasn't a complete disaster and there was a lot I could do to change my way of life. </p>
            <p>Mark gave me encouragement and made me feel completely at ease and took away a lot of my fears and anxiety. </p>
            <p>Mark started me on a programme of sensible eating (not a diet) and exercise which wasn't difficult to achieve and that encouraged me to keep going. </p>
            <p>I felt comfortable in just a baggy t-shirt and tracksuit bottoms (no need for special clothing). Mark made me start to feel good about myself, encouraging me through all the exercises. </p>
            <p>Now after just a few months I feel confident to wear proper gym wear. I am mentally brighter, happier and definitely fitter! </p>
            <p>I look forward to my gym sessions. I never thought I would be using weights and other equipment and even a bit of boxing (pad punching)! </p>
            <p>Now sessions are tougher but achieving a higher standard gives me enormous satisfaction, friends have even noticed a difference in my physical and mental health. </p>
            <p>Although, weight loss wasn't my priority, fitness and feeling better was. </p>
            <p>3 Months later and I now weigh 75.1kg, my visceral fat has reduced from 13 to 11.5, my BMI has gone from 30.3 to 27.6, body fat 47.8% to 44% and my hips from 116.5cm to 110.1cm. </p>
            <p>I stand straighter (and when I went for a check up at the surgery, the nurse said my height had increased), walk better and have gone down to smaller trousers and dresses. </p>
            <p>I have more energy to do the things I like doing and importantly in the process of coming off my blood pressure medication as it has come down and stabilised. </p>
            <p>I've also managed to reduce my pain relief medication (for my neck following surgery) which I had been taking for 12 years. Hope to soon be able to stop taking it completely. </p>
            <p>I see this as a major change in my life. I can now run up and down the stairs without holding on and my general fitness has improved. </p>
            <p>I still have a way to go, but with Mark's help and encouragement, plus my determination, I know I will get there. </p>
            <p>So far I feel I have achieved a lot in a relatively short time. I'm looking forward to the next few months working with Mark and achieving my next goals. </p>
            <p>I never thought I would ever use a personal trainer, but having done so I know I couldn't have achieved what I have without Mark's help and guidance. </p>
            <p></p>
